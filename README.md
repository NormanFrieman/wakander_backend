<h1>Wakander Project - Backend</h1>

This is the code referring to the backend of the <bold>Wakander</bold> project.

# Components

This project consists of a component, the back-end. The backend was developed using: express.js to establish the routes, [knex](http://knexjs.org/) as a query builer and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database.

## Developing Backend

To get started with developing on backend, install all Node-related dependencies with a simple `npm install`. After that, copy over `config-template.json` to `config.json` and adjust all required values (surrounded by `<<>>`).

For developing, use `npm test` to start.
