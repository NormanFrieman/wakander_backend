<h1>Wakander Project - Backend</h1>

This is the code referring to the backend of the <bold>Wakander</bold> project.

# Components

This project consists of a component, the back-end. The backend was developed using: express.js to establish the routes, [knex](http://knexjs.org/) as a query builer and [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database.

## Developing Backend

To get started with developing on backend, install all Node-related dependencies with a simple `npm install`. After that, copy over `config-template.json` to `config.json` and adjust all required values (surrounded by `<<>>`).

For developing, use `npm test` to start.

## Routes

The routes were separated into: generic and exclusive. Generics, as the name suggests, can be used by all entities. Exclusives are unique routes to serve a specific purpose of an entity.

### 1) Generic routes

Generic routes are:

* Create new data to be saved in the database
    - [https://wakanderbackend.herokuapp.com/create/:def]

* Log in
    - [https://wakanderbackend.herokuapp.com/login/:def]

* Delete data from the database
    - [https://wakanderbackend.herokuapp.com/delete/:def]

* List all data in a table
    - [https://wakanderbackend.herokuapp.com/list/:def]

* List data specific to a table
    - [https://wakanderbackend.herokuapp.com/bylist/:def/:id/:search]
